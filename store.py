Persistence: what was retrieved, and what was answered over it.
==============================================================
Everything the pipeline learned used to die with the process. Each demo run
re-fetched the same rows from releasetrain.io, and the only record that a run
happened at all was whatever the user still had on screen. Two concrete costs:

  * **A host that cannot reach the API answers nothing.** The fetchers in
    `app_1.py` return an "API unavailable" placeholder row and the answer is
    composed over it. Yet the rows needed to answer are the same rows the last
    twenty runs already fetched.
  * **No run is inspectable after the fact.** The paper's failure analysis is
    reconstructed from harness artifacts in `results/`, which the demo does not
    write. A question answered in the UI leaves no trace to point at.

This module is the store that fixes both, and nothing more. It is deliberately
*not* a second retrieval system: ranking stays in `fetch_union`, intent in
`intent`, record typing in `vendor`. The store holds documents and runs.

    documents      one row per retrieved document, keyed the same way
                   `fetch_union.doc_key` dedupes them, so a document fetched
                   under three phrasings is one row and not three.
    documents_fts  FTS5 over product/title/notes, which is what makes the
                   offline fallback a search rather than a dump.
    runs           one row per answered question: the phrasings, the intent,
                   the answer, the timings.
    run_documents  which documents that run retrieved, at what rank, and
                   which ones the answer cited.

`sqlite3` from the standard library, on purpose. `requirements.txt` is pinned
so a re-run reproduces the reported numbers, and a store that exists to make
the demo survive a dead network should not itself add a dependency that can
fail to install. One file under `data/`, gitignored like the other fetched
data -- it is a cache and a log, not a source.

Every write is best-effort from the caller's point of view: `record_*` raises
nothing a demo has to catch, because a store failing must never be the reason
a question goes unanswered. Read paths are explicit and do raise, since a
caller asking the store a question wants the answer or the error.
