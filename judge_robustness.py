"""
Does the finding survive a different judge?
===========================================
Every answer number in this project comes from one LLM judge, `ollama:llama3.1`,
which is also the model driving the Query Rewriter inside the system under
test. That is the standing caveat on the results. This script measures how much
it matters, rather than arguing about it.

Two questions, both answered by re-judging a run's own stored answers with a
second model:

  1. Agreement. On the same (question, answer) pairs, how close are the two
     judges? Reported as mean absolute difference and exact-agreement rate, per
     metric, so a reader can see whether the judges merely differ in calibration
     (a constant offset, harmless to a paired comparison) or in ordering (fatal
     to it).

  2. Robustness of the conclusion. The headline result is a paired difference
     between two arms -- e.g. faithfulness(marag_llm) - faithfulness(marag),
     which isolates answer format because the two arms retrieve identically.
     The script recomputes that difference under the second judge and reports
     whether its sign and significance survive. A finding that flips under a
     different judge is a finding about the judge.

Nothing is re-generated: the answers are read from per_query.jsonl exactly as
the run produced them, so this isolates the judge and changes nothing else.

Usage:
    python judge_robustness.py results/run_<id> --judge ollama:qwen2.5:7b-instruct
    python judge_robustness.py results/run_<id> --judge ollama:qwen2.5:7b-instruct \
        --arms marag_llm,marag --metric faithfulness --sample 40
