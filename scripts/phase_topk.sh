# Why this exists. On the n=100 frozen ablation the multi-agent arm held 520
# judged-relevant documents in its candidate pool against the baseline's 434 --
# including 110 the baseline never fetched -- yet shipped 145 in top_k against
# the baseline's 150. Pool recall separated cleanly (0.979 vs 0.845); recall@5
# and nDCG@3 did not. The obvious reading, "the reranker is worse", does not
# survive a matched-ceiling control (diff -0.049, p=0.16), because marag's pool
# is 1.48x larger and competes for the same 4 slots. That leaves top_k as the
# suspected throttle, and this script is the experiment that settles it.
#
# MARAG_RERANK is pinned to embed (the strongest arm) throughout: varying two
# things at once would make the result uninterpretable. The k=4 pass is the
# control -- it must reproduce the embed arm of scripts/phase_ablation.sh.
#
# Read the results with: scripts/topk_report.py
