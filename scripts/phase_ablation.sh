# Everything below lives inside main(). That is not style, it is the fix for a
# real failure: bash streams a script from a byte offset while it runs, so
# editing this file mid-sweep shifts the offsets under the running shell. On
# 2026-08-30 a commit landed here during a sweep, execution resumed inside the
# comment block below, and bash tried to run the word "leak" out of the phrase
# "leaves gaps that leak on every arm". Under `set -e` that killed the run after
# the record pass, and the three arms that carry the claim never executed.
# A function body is parsed to its closing brace before any of it runs, so the
# whole script is in memory before the first pass starts and a later edit cannot
# reach it.
