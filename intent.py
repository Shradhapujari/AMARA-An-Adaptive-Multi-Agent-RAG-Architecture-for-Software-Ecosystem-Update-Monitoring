Intent classification: what kind of question was asked.
=======================================================
The pipeline runs three retrieval agents -- release notes, CVE feed, community
posts -- and, until now, ran all three at full weight on every question. That
is why "What is the latest Linux version?" came back led by security advisories:
the CVE pool is far larger than the release pool (449 vs 157 rows for `q=Linux`,
measured 2026-09-01), so an unweighted union is a security answer whatever was
asked.

Three intents, because they are the three the corpus actually distinguishes and
each one routes differently:

    security   "Any critical CVEs in Chrome?"        -> advisories are evidence
    release    "What is the latest Linux version?"   -> only shipped releases
    opinion    "Is anyone else hating the new UI?"   -> community posts are
                                                        evidence, releases are
                                                        context

The distinction matters beyond ranking. For a `release` question a CVE record
is not weak evidence, it is *wrong* evidence -- its `versionNumber` is an
affected-version string, not a version that shipped (see `vendor.classify_record`).
For an `opinion` question the honest answer cites what people said, and a
release note is not a person's opinion. So intent decides which pools may be
cited at all, not merely what to put first.

Rule-based and clock-free, for the reasons `temporal` and `vendor` are: it runs
where no model is reachable and has to be testable offline. `classify` returns
the scores alongside the label so a caller can see how close the runner-up was
and a weak call can be surfaced as "needs clarification" rather than guessed at.

Ground truth for the accuracy claim is upstream's own labelling: the
`/api/reddit/query/questions` endpoint carries `isAboutCve` per post over 5,189
real user questions. `scripts/eval_intent.py` scores this classifier against it.
